# Architecture & Optimization Strategies

## High-Level Design

- **PS5 Discovery & Authentication:**  
  Implement the logic to discover and authenticate with the PS5 using the Remote Play protocol.

- **Data Streaming:**  
  Use efficient codecs (e.g., H.264/H.265, hardware acceleration if possible) for video/audio streaming. Prefer UDP for real-time data.

- **Input Relay:**  
  Capture and transmit controller input from the PC to the PS5 with minimal latency.

- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Use multi-threading for parallel processing of video, audio, and input.
  - Employ ring buffers and zero-copy mechanisms where possible.
  - Profile with tools like `valgrind`, `perf`, or Visual Studio Profiler.
  - Allow users to tune buffer size, bitrate, and resolution.

## Future Considerations

- Support for additional platforms (Android, iOS).
- UI for easy configuration and monitoring.
- Advanced error recovery for network interruptions.
